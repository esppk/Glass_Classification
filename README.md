# Glass_Classification
Udacity Capstone Project
In this project, I will use a public available data set to build a model to identify the type of the glass
sample by their chemical or physical attributes. The data set was originally used by Ian W Evett et al in
a paper with similar task. However, that paper was published in 1987, the approaches used in the
paper are more likely to be out of date. With development of both computer science and machine
learning, this project can implement newly developed techniques to see whether we can out-perform
the result of the original paper.
